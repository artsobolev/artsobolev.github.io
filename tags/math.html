        <section><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen%27s_inequality">Jensen's inequality</a> is a powerful tool often used in mathematical derivations and analyses. It states that for a convex function $f(x)$ and an arbitrary random variable $X$ we have the following <em>upper</em> bound:
$$
f\left(\E X\right)
\le
\E f\left(X\right)
$$</p>
<p>However, oftentimes we want the inequality to work in the other direction, to give a <em>lower</em> bound. In this post I'll outline one possible approach to this.</p>

        <section><p>Many tasks of machine learning can be posed as optimization problems. One comes up with a parametric model, defines a loss function, and then minimizes it in order to learn optimal parameters. One very powerful tool of optimization theory is the use of smooth (differentiable) functions: those that can be locally approximated with a linear functions.
We all surely know how to differentiate a function, but often it's more convenient to perform all the derivations in matrix form, since many computational packages like numpy or matlab are optimized for vectorized expressions.</p>
<p>In this post I want to outline the general idea of how one can calculate derivatives in vector and matrix spaces (but the idea is general enough to be applied to other algebraic structures).</p>

        <section><p>Sometime ago when Facebook opensourced their <a title="Folly is an open-source C++ library developed and used at Facebook" href="https://github.com/facebook/folly">Folly library</a> I was reading their docs and found <a title="folly/FBvector.h documentation" href="https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/docs/FBVector.md">something interesting</a>. In section "Memory Handling" they state <blockquote>In fact it can be mathematically proven that a growth factor of 2 is rigorously the worst possible because it never allows the vector to reuse any of its previously-allocated memory</blockquote>I haven't got it first time. Recently I recalled that article and decided to deal with it. So after reading and googling for a while I finally understood the idea, so I'd like to say a few words about it.</p>
